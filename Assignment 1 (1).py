# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
# * 
# 'hello'
# -87.8
# - 
# / 
# 
# 
# 6 
# 
# 
# Values : 'hello',-87.8,6

# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?
# 
# String : A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in a single('') or double(" ") quotes.
# 
# Variable : A variable is a label for storing values and accessing when needed.

# 3. Describe three different data types.
# 
# The most common data types used in python for numbers -INTEGER,FLOAT and for words we use STRING.
# 
# #integer - 12
# #float - 23.45
# #string - "Fred" or 'Fred' or '23'
# 
# Precisely in Python,type() is used for getting type of the object.
# 
# Integers can positive or negative numbers.
#  Ex : -4,-3,3,4,0
# 
# Floats are real numbers but also includes decimals.
#  Ex : 2.3344,3.145
#  
# String is a sequence of characters enclosed in ' ' or " " but not the mixed ' ".
#  Ex : "Fred"
#  
# Boolean - Boolean is one of the most used data type.It can take only one of two values either True or False.
# 
#  

# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
# 
# An expression is made of operations like simple arithemetic operations(+,-,*,/).
#  Ex : 4+3+2+1,4-3,5*6
# 
# An expression evaluates the task given.

# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
# 
# A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, while an expression is any section of the code that evaluates to a value.
# 
# Ex for expression :
# min(2,3)
# 'Foo'
# 2+3+4
# 2*3
# 
# Ex for statement:
# print()
# if condition:
# for value in variable:

# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1
# 
# 
# 23

# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# 'spam' + 'spamspam'
# 'spam' * 3
# 
# 
# 'spamspamspam'

# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
# 
# Variable name should start with letter or an underscore.
# So 'eggs' is valid variable name while 100 isn't.
# The first letter of variable name must be alphabet or underscore.
